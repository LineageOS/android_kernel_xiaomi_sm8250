	  This symbol can be depended upon by arch implementations of the
	  ChaCha library interface that require the generic code as a
	  fallback, e.g., for SIMD implementations. If no arch specific
	  implementation is enabled, this implementation serves the users
	  of CRYPTO_LIB_CHACHA.

	  Enable the ChaCha library interface. This interface may be fulfilled
	  by either the generic implementation or an arch-specific one, if one
	  is available and enabled.
