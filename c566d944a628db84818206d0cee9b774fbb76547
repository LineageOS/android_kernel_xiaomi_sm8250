Back in lineage-19.1 days when I was still using their old kernel, everything were working fine, and I\u0027m using it as my daily driver. Problems happens after they updated the kernel in lineage-20. Apart from that, I don\u0027t know how to make proper screen cutout overlay and adapt QDCM configs yet. You can take my device tree if you find it useful...\n\nhttps://github.com/me-cafebabe-backyard/android_device_xiaomi_umi/commits/lineage-21/",
