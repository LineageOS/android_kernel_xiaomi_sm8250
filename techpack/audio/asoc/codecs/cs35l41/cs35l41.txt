CS35L41 Speaker Amplifier

Required properties:

  - compatible : "cirrus,cs35l41"
                 "cirrus,cs35l40"

  - reg : the SPI chip select line for the device

  - VA-supply, VP-supply : power supplies for the device,
    as covered in
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.

Optional properties:
  - cirrus,sclk-force-output : Audio serial port SCLK force
  output control. Forces the SCLK to continue to drive even
  if no ASP_TXn channels are enabled.

  - cirrus,lrclk-force-output : Audio serial port LRCLK force
  output control. Forces the LRCLK to continue to drive even
  if no ASP_TXn channels are enabled.

  - cirrus,right-channel-amp : Boolean to determine which channel
  the amplifier is to receive the audio data on. If present the
  amplifier receives data on the right channel of I2S data.
  If not present the amplifier receives data on the left
  channel of I2S data

  - cirrus,boost-ctl-millivolt : Boost Voltage Value. Configures the
  boost converter's output voltage in mV. The range is from 2550 mV to
  11000 mV with increments of 50 mV.
  (Default) VP

  Boost hardware configuration:

      These three properties should be used together to specify the external
      component configuration of the part. See section 4.3.6 of the datasheet
      for details regarding how these values are used to configure the
      digital boost converter's control loop.

      - cirrus,boost-peak-milliamp : Boost-converter peak current limit in mA.
      Configures the peak current by monitoring the current through the boost FET.
      Range starts at 1600 mA and goes to a maximum of 4500 mA with increments
      of 50 mA.
      (Default) 4.50 Amps

      - cirrus,boost-ind-nanohenry : Boost inductor value, expressed in nH. Valid
      values include 1000, 1200, 1500 and 2200.

      - cirrus,boost-cap-microfarad : Total equivalent boost capacitance on the VBST
      and VAMP pins, derated at 11 volts DC. The value must be rounded to the
      nearest integer and expressed in uF.

  - cirrus,amp-gain-zc : Boolean to determine whether to use the amplifier
  gain-change zero-crossing feature. If the feature is enabled, any
  user-controlled amplifier gain change will occur on a zero-crossing point.
  (Default) Disabled

  - cirrus,temp-warn-threshold : Amplifier overtemperature warning threshold.
  Configures the threshold at which the overtemperature warning condition occurs.
  When the threshold is met, the ovetemperature warning attenuation is applied
  and the TEMP_WARN_EINT interrupt status bit is set.
  If TEMP_WARN_MASK = 0, INTb is asserted.

  0 = 105C
  1 = 115C
  2 = 125C (Default)
  3 = 135C

  - cirrus,noise-gate-enable : DSP Noise Gate feature. If present, noise
  gate feature will be enabled.

  - cirrus,noise-gate-threshold : Threshold of audio signal input which the
  noise gate considers the input audio to be at a low enough level to be
  valid to enter a noise gating state of operation.

  0 = -66 dBFS
  1 = -72 dBFS
  2 = -78 dBFS
  3 = -84 dBFS (default)
  4 = -90 dBFS
  5 = -96 dBFS
  6 = -102 dBFS
  7 = -108 dBFS

  - cirrus,noise-gate-delay : Time that the incoming audio signal must be
  below the noise gate threshold prior to entering a noise gated state

  0 = 5 ms
  1 = 10 ms
  2 = 25 ms
  3 = 50 ms (default)
  4 = 100 ms
  5 = 250 ms
  6 = 500 ms
  7 = 1 s
  8 = 5 s
  9 = 10 s
  10 = 20 s
  11 = 30 s
  12 = 40 s
  13 = 50 s
  14 = 60 s
  15 = 120 s

Optional H/G Algorithm sub-node:

  The cs35l41 node can have a single "cirrus,classh-internal-algo" sub-node
  that will disable automatic control of the internal H/G Algorithm.

  It is strongly recommended that the Datasheet be referenced when adjusting
  or using these Class H Algorithm controls over the internal Algorithm.
  Serious damage can occur to the Device and surrounding components.

  - cirrus,classh-internal-algo : Sub-node for the Internal Class H Algorithm
  See Section 4.4 Internal Class H Algorithm in the Datasheet.
  If not used, the device manages the ClassH Algorithm internally.

Optional properties for the "cirrus,classh-internal-algo" Sub-node

  Section 7.9 Boost Control
  - cirrus,classh-bst-overide : Boolean
  - cirrus,classh-bst-max-limit

  - cirrus,classh-headroom
  - cirrus,classh-release-rate
  - cirrus,classh-mem-depth

  - cirrus,classh-wk-fet-thld


Optional GPIO1 sub-node:

The cs35l41 node can have an single "cirrus,gpio-config1" sub-node for
configuring the GPIO1 pin.

- cirrus,gpio-polarity-invert : Boolean which specifies whether the GPIO1
level is inverted. If this property is not present the level is not inverted.

- cirrus,gpio-output-enable : Boolean which specifies whether the GPIO1 pin
is configured as an output. If this property is not present the
pin will be configured as an input.

- cirrus,gpio-src-select : Configures the function of the GPIO1 pin.
Note that the options are different from the GPIO2 pin.

0 = High Impedance (Default)
1 = GPIO
2 = Sync
3 = MCLK input


Optional GPIO2 sub-node:

The cs35l41 node can have an single "cirrus,gpio-config2" sub-node for
configuring the GPIO1 pin.

- cirrus,gpio-polarity-invert : Boolean which specifies whether the GPIO2
level is inverted. If this property is not present the level is not inverted.

- cirrus,gpio-output-enable : Boolean which specifies whether the GPIO2 pin
is configured as an output. If this property is not present the
pin will be configured as an input.

- cirrus,gpio-src-select : Configures the function of the GPIO2 pin.
Note that the options are different from the GPIO1 pin.

0 = High Impedance (Default)
1 = GPIO
2 = Open Drain INTB
3 = MCLK input
4 = Push-pull INTB (active low)
